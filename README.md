# fusion809 Overlay
This is merely a simple overlay that I (fusion809) has put together so that the [`funtoo-overlay`](https://github.com/funtoo/funtoo-overlay) repository can sync from it. Although some packages are fixed packages I need on my Gentoo installation these fixed packages are:

* `dev-libs/mpc-1.0.3`, when I synced Portage on 29 March 2017 I did so just before a checksum issue was fixed with this package
* `games-rpg/runescape-launcher-2.2.3`, this package frequently fails checksum tests as its Debian binary is often updated.
