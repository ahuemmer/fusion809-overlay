# fusion809 Overlay
This is my own personal overlay. The [funtoo-overlay](https://github.com/funtoo/funtoo-overlay) is also synced from it. 

If you use the runit-service/service-x package be sure to enable the [powerman-overlay](https://github.com/powerman/powerman-overlay) too as it's forked from it and depends on many packages provided by it.
